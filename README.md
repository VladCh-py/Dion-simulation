Dion.py allows you to simulate the movement of a dion in electric and magnetic fields. The calculation is performed by the Runge-Kutta method of the 4th order.
The electrostatic field is directed along the X-axis. The vector of magnetic induction along the Z axis. It is possible to set the components of the dion velocity, mass, electric charge and magnetic charge.

Dion.pdf contains a brief description of the main methods used in the simulation and their comparison. The simulation results for various parameters are presented.
